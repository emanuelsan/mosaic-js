## 2. Rocket Sled
Using more of ACME's notorious tools, Wile E. Coyote gives his classic dynamite rocket another try by building a high-tech rocket-sled that uses railroad tracks to help direct him towards the Road Runner. In Merrie Melodies' short "Beep Prepared," Wile E. Coyote orders ACME's Little Giant DIY Rocket-Sled Kit, and successfully builds it.

Unfortunately for Wile E. Coyote, the same thing that happened to his dynamite rocket happens again, and rather than stay on track, his ACME Rocket-Sled shoots him straight up into the sky. Despite its directional flaw, the Rocket-Sled itself is very powerful, and if Wile E. Coyote were to work out a few tweaks, he might be able to catch the Road Runner.
